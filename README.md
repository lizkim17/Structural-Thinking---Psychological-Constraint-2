# Project Description

## Research Question

How does exposure to structural information, such as the gender of scientists in STEM textbooks, impact children's structural reasoning about gender-based disparities in STEM achievement?

## Hypothesis

I hypothesize that exposure to structural information demonstrating that the gender of scientists in STEM textbooks influences girls’ achievement in STEM activities will increase children’s likelihood of attributing gender disparities in STEM achievement to structural factors.

## Data Use

I will use ST-P 2 Dataset Final.csv file, which is the dataset exported from Qualtrics.

# Submission format

I submitted a link of a new repo (<https://github.com/lizkim17/Structural-Thinking---Psychological-Constraint-2/tree/main>).
