# Research Project Assessment

**This assessment is for the final research project only.** Use the `assessment.md` file for all mini-projects.

## Instructions

Before submitting your research project draft for grading, confirm:

1.  The manuscript .qmd for your project is in the root directory and knits to .pdf without error.
2.  The knitted .pdf of your draft is in the root directory, with the same filename as the .qmd.
3.  This `research-assessment.md` file is in the root directory of your project repo.
4.  Dr. Dowling and your section TA are collaborators on your GitHub repo with permissions to pull/push.

To complete this assessment:

1.  Complete the basic information section and AI statement.
2.  Confirm all links are correct and accessible
3.  Check off all objectives you are attempting to demonstrate
    1.  To earn 30 points you must demonstrate each objective. However, you do not need to attempt all objectives with each draft if your goal is to build the project over time.
    2.  If the objective is demonstrated somewhere other than the .qmd, add a note in the grader comments section for where to find it (e.g., "see `data-cleaning.R` lines 20-30").
4.  Optionally, complete the reflection section, which may earn engagement points.

## AI Statement

Describe whether and how you used AI/LLMs when completing this project: I used ChatGPT and Google to debug when I encountered errors in my code.

Optionally (for engagement points) reflect on your use of AI: I tend to use AI a lot when coding; however, for this class, I used it significantly less. I mostly consulted with my lab advisor, which was more helpful. I also used Dr. Dowling's demo codes and APA examples, which was extremely helpful. Lastly, asking questions in person and asking for help and sometimes answering for my classmates' questions in slack helped me advance my R skills a lot more.

## Overall requirements

Overall requirements for the research project are as follows:

1.  The project must be a research project. It must provide background on a research topic, ask at least one research question, use data to attempt to answer that question, report the results of the data analysis, and interpret the results in the context of the research question.
2.  The project must be contained in a github repository that follows git best practices and includes all necessary files to run the project from start to finish, including:
    1.  The .qmd file for the manuscript
    2.  All data files used in the project
    3.  All scripts used in the project
    4.  A README.md file & .gitignore file
3.  The project must be reproducible -- a reader should be able to clone the repo and run the .qmd from start to finish without error. The .qmd file should include:
    1.  A YAML header with all fields necessary for an APA manuscript
    2.  Setup source chunks that load libraries, read in data, set chunk options, set seed, etc.
    3.  Minimally, an IMRD structure (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion), though it may be more complex
    4.  Integration of markdown and code chunks throughout, following best practices for using code chunks
    5.  Figures and tables rendered in code chunks
    6.  Inline R code & references to render data-dependent text
    7.  At least 1 descriptive analysis and 1 hypothesis test, either in code chunks or sourced scripts
    8.  Frequent and informative code comments throughout
4.  The .qmd file should knit/render to an APA7 formatted manuscript with one click and no errors. The knitted manuscript should include:
    1.  A title page with title, author, and institutional affiliation
    2.  An abstract (this may be minimal, but should exist)
    3.  Narrative text comprising a complete research report
    4.  APA7 references, both in-text citations and a References page
    5.  Publication-ready figures (2+) and tables (1+)
    6.  Results of all analyses presented in-text (and where appropriate, in tables), with no raw R output; where possible, all text should be data-dependent and rendered with inline R code
    7.  Quarto generated references to all figures and tables
    8.  Statistical analyses and figures interpreted in narrative text
5.  The .qmd should render a .pdf identical to the .pdf you submit for grading

## Assessment

The final project must demonstrate each of 30 the course learning objectives, each worth 1 point.

Below each learning objective is a list of general expectations for meeting that objective. You should aim to meet all expectations to earn a point for meeting the objective, but these are not rigid requirements. For example, writing a complex and creative function that uses multiple arguments and returns a complex output could meet the "parse and define functions and arguments" objective, even if it is only used in one context.

Refer to the website for general tips on meeting these objectives and an FAQ.

### GitHub and R Studio

1.  Create and maintain a repo with sensible organization and naming conventions

    1.  All folder and file names are informative

    2.  Uses relative paths correctly

    3.  Does not have duplicate/redundant elements

        -   [x] Objective attempt
        -   [ ] Objective met
        -   Grader comments:
            -   Repo/file/folder names should be informative and relevant to content, not class context (e.g., nrdowling/infant-gesture not nrdowling/d2m-project; infant-gestures.qmd not d2m-final.qmd).
            -   Repo should not contain any files unrelated to the project (e.g, files from the example apaquarto manuscript)
            -   Project files should be in the top level of the repository

2.  Maintain an informative and up-to-date README.md

    1.  Includes description of repo purpose, data use, research questions, etc.

    2.  Outlines the repo structure with file tree or similar

        -   [x] Objective attempt
        -   [ ] Objective met
        -   Grader comments:
            -   The content of your README is fine, but since you don't have it in the top level of your repo it isn't being processed as a README. You'll know its working correctly if you see it render on the github page beneath the files.

3.  integrate a GitHub repo with an R studio project, including .gitignore file

    1.  All scripts run and all notebooks render if the repo is cloned to another location

    2.  .gitingore comprehensively excludes unnecessary, private, and very large files and are commented appropriately

        -   [x] Objective attempt
        -   [ ] Objective met
        -   Grader comments:
            -   .gitignore should include (minimally) a localonly folder and pdf render files (e.g., the \*\_files folder, .ttt, .tex., .log, etc.), as well as comments describing the ignored items (in addition to the default ignored items if youâ€™re using a template)

4.  effectively use version control

    1.  Used frequent, informative commit messages

    2.  Relies on document revisions rather than manually created new versions

        -   [x] Objective attempt

### R programming

5.  Find, install, require, and load R packages

    1.  No errors occur when running scripts in a new environment

        1.  If packages other than the "class packages" listed on the resources page are used, code to install/require them is included *and commented out*
        2.  When a reader opts-in to installing packages by uncommenting the code, it runs without errors

    2.  Uses more than one function to install/load/require packages (including those used in commented code)

        -   [x] Objective attempt
        -   [ ] Objective met
        -   Grader comments:
            -   I see your pilot R script uses both install and load functions, but you need to include (commented out) installs in your .qmd since the .R file isn't run when you knit the document
            -   Refer to the d2mr resources page for a list of the packages you can load without a commented out install line.

6.  Use arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators

    1.  Uses all three types of operators

    2.  Uses multiple operators in data transformation pipelines and/or inline R code

        -   [x] Objective attempt
        -   [ ] Objective met
        -   Grader comments:

9.  Use `readr` functions to read in and write out data

        -   [x] Objective attempt
        -   [ ] Objective met
        -   Grader comments:

        -   Grader comments: I see that you do a lot of line-by-line/column-by-column reassignment and text replacement in both you .R script and .qmd. You can use stringr functions to do the same things much more efficiently!

12. Use `forcats` functions to work with factor variables

    1.  Uses ate least 2 unique `forcats` functions or one function in 2 unique contexts (with different purposes)
    2.  Uses `forcats` functions in a data transformation pipeline

    -   NOTE: Though they are base R functions, `factor()` and `levels()` can be used to meet this objective as long as they are used in a way that demonstrates the same skills as `forcats` functions, which should involve including optional arguments

        -   [x] Objective attempt
        -   [x] Objective met

## Reflection (Optional)

Achieving all 30 learning objectives was challenging. However, I overcame this by checking off a few each day and regularly attending office hours. I aimed to attend at least one office hour per week, which I believe may earn me high engagement points for proactively seeking help and staying engaged in this class. For a few learning objectives, my implementation was not as coherent since I was primarily focused on demonstrating them. However, I formatted the QMD file as an appendix, utilizing the APA structure in a way that ensures these sections do not disrupt the readability of my final report.

The most rewarding aspect of this project was learning how to use code chunks with appropriate labels effectively (following the "one thing, one chunk" rule) and developing a workflow that allows me to render a PDF file with one click (even though I will need to manually adjust the white space and improve the structure for a more polished final version). Another valuable skill I learned was using citer and Zotero to create in-text citations and a reference list. Lastly, I feel much more confident using version control with GitHub. I gained many practical skills that I can apply to real research, and for that, I am very gratefulâ€”thank you, Dr. Dowling!

If I were to start over, I would improve my time management skills so that I could submit my final project multiple times throughout the quarter instead of only twice at the end. However, I am proud of what I created for my final report, including four publication-quality figures and two APA-style tables with results reported using inline code. I also consistently made useful commit messages while pushing to GitHub, which may help me earn more engagement points.

## Grading

All final projects are graded by Dr. Dowling. You will see your grade on Canvas separated into two categories: objective points and engagement points.

-   **Objective points:** 11/30
-   **Engagement points:** 3/10
-   **Total points:** 14/40

**Comments:** Nice start, Liz! You've got a great foundation in place. Looking forward to reading your final draft! Be sure to reorganize your git repo before your next submission. Most importantly, your project should exist in the top level of the repo.
